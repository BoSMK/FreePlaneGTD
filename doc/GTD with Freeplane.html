### What's Getting Things Done?

Getting Things Done is a task management methodology developed
by David Allen. It's primarily focused on the following 
[five steps](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/) 
1. Capture (Collect your tasks/ideas)
1. Clarify (Identify what is to be done)
1. Organize (Assign the tasks to  corresponding projects)
1. Reflect (Review to see what is done)
1. Engage (Do the actual tasks)

Please see the [Official site](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) for 
more information.

name:install
# Getting started

## Install Freeplane

Download and install [Freeplane](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net) 
for your computer.

## Install the add-on

Install the [Freeplane GTD+ add-on](http://www.itworks.hu/freeplanegtd-release/)
in Freeplane using the Tools -> Add-ons menu. Either you download 
it locally and open the file using the file browser, or paste the 
URL directly to the file selection dialog.

After installation, you must restart Freeplane, to use the add-on.

name:start
# Starting up the GTD system

You should create your own GTD structure, to assist the 5 steps. 
An example file can be downloaded <a href='GTD_template.mm' download>here</a>.

This template covers the simplest possible GTD set-up, which 
can be customized to your GTD system. You can create your sections at will, 
restructure the map to your liking. The six most commonly used sections are in the template.

* Inbox - is for holding the __Captured__ tasks, and for performing basic __Clarification__.
* Projects - is for holding all kind of personal/business projects once they are __Clarified__ and __Organised__
* Someday - Maybe - is for holding tasks that are not readily actionable, but are not to be forgotten
* Review - is for holding the completed tasks waiting for __Reflection__
* Archive - is for holding __Reflected__ items, that have some importance to be remembered for 
* Config - is a technical section to hold configuration information specific to this map

---
name:create-bi
# Creating tasks and projects using Freeplane built-ins

The __Collection__ and __Clarification__ tasks can be performed by created by 
creating simple text nodes in the mindmap. Once the tasks are marked with the
![important](yes.png) icon, the add-on will consider it as a task.

The __Organization__ can be performed by creating projects and, dragging/moving the tasks 
to their corresponding projects. The add-on will consider nodes marked with a 
![list](list.png) icon as a project.

The projects can be marked complete using the ![ok](button_ok.png) icon.

These icons can be configured to your liking in the configuration nodes.

The other important task aspects like, When, Where, Who can be specified by 
node attributes, using the Attribute freeplaneGTD.editor Alt-F9.

It's a good idea to use the notes feature of Freeplane to add more information 
about the task in the __Clarification__ phase.

name:create-ao
# Creating tasks using shortcuts

The other possibility of defining tasks is by using the shortcut notation, 
where the node text is formatted in a way, that it can be converted to a task.
It must start with a * like:
```bash
    * Your task here
```
Once the add-on task collection is executed using either Alt-H or when 
opening the task list with Ctrl-H. it  will be converted to 

![yes](yes.png) Your task here

---

# Creating tasks using shortcuts 2.
 
Task properties can also be specified in shortcuts,
```bash 
    * Your task must be completed [someone] {date} #2 @Context
```
Will be converted to a priority 2 task 

![yes](yes.png)![2](full-2.png) Your task must be completed
* Who - someone
* Where - Context
* When - date

You can specify any text for these attributes, but be aware of the following. 
* The add-on will try to guess the date format using several standard formats, 
so it can be used for sorting the tasks by date.
* Priorities must be numeric from 0 to 9
* The contexts cannot contain spaces, but more than one may be specified
* More than one responsible can be assigned 

---
name:edit
# Editing tasks and projects using the add-on

The add-on provides a simple freeplaneGTD.editor that can be used to edit the created tasks.

The freeplaneGTD.editor can be invoked using, the F4 key on a selected task.

You can change the attributes of the tasks here, as well as mark them as done.

---
name:task-list
# Using the task list

The task list is the main feature of the add-on. It can show the tasks in the current 
map sorted according to the four basic task aspects.
* By project - a list of tasks organized by project
* By responsible - a list of tasks by responsible
* By context - tasks by context
* Timeline view - tasks organized by time

The group of tasks are all organized according to priority and date.
Tasks without specified priority are considered to have priority 5.

You can use the buttons next to the grouped items to copy the data to
the clipboard, or to select the corresponding items in the map.

You can use the checkboxes on the bottom, to show/hide the completed tasks
and to show/hide the notes for the tasks.

---
name:review
# Performing task reviews

As a preparation for a reviews the done items from each project, 
can be moved to the review section. 

Once all done items are moved to the Review section, they can be reviewed manually.

After review and reflection the items can either be simply deleted, or moved 
to the archive section. 

---
name:engage
# Supporting task engagement

The tasks can support task execution in two simple ways. 

First of all they can be a placeholder for the mindmap corresponding 
to the task itself. Notes, information about the task can be kept under it, 
as well as corresponding subtasks could be also added here.

The second is the done status. It's not only important to know if a task 
is done, or not, but it also gives a great satisfaction, when a task item 
is finally checked.
---
name: customization
# Customization - Preferences

Some basic behaviour of the add-on can be configured from the Freeplane settings. 
Open Tools -> Settings menu, select add-ons, and scroll to FreeplaneGTD section to set these up.

* Filter done items - Whether to filter done items by default when the action list is opened
* Initial view - Which tab to open the list view, by default
* Auto collapse upon selection - Whether to collapse all branches automatically, when 
  an item is selected from the action list  
---
# Customization - Icons

The icons used by the add-on are configured using simple nodes. It's best to collect them under 
a configuration node, but feel free to throw them around your map, if you like.

The configuration nodes must be assigned a single item, if there are 
multiple icons, only the first one will be considered!

Configuration takes the form
```bash
     Icon: OPTION
```

Where _OPTION_ can be
* Next Action - Action icon 
* Project - To specify the project icon
* Done - To specify the completed icon

If _OPTION_ starts with a @ it will be considered a Context icon.

Have a great time using this tool, and don't forget to drop me a line if you 
have an idea for enhancing it's features!
